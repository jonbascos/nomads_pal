# Nomad's Pal

Version 1.0: 

An app created for the Digital Nomad or anyone that is looking for a place to work out of.  

This app/site will show you community currated locations (Cafe's and Co-Working spaces) where other Digital Nomad's have been to.  This site will allow you to:
 
* Search for locations within a City and State in the United States and provide you with the address, phone number, Web Site, upload and download speeds that other people have achieved.
 
* Add locations to the app so other Digital Nomads can find the location.
 
What do I envision this app to be like?
 
This app will be an ever-improving app that will continue to grow as the community grows and other locations are added.  In   the future, users will be able to log into the app and keep a list of places they have submitted and edit them as needed.  Companies will be able to join in as well and add their locations.

In progress:

* Implementing pagination to show only 5 results at a time if there are more than 5 results.
* Ability to upload photos of the location when submitting or editing a new location.
